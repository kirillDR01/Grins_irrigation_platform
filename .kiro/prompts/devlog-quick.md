# Quick Devlog Entry

Create a streamlined devlog entry for quick progress updates while maintaining good documentation standards.

## Instructions

1. **Create a focused entry** with essential information:
   - Brief but clear description of what was accomplished
   - Key technical details or decisions
   - Impact on the project
   - Next immediate steps

2. **Use a simplified format** but still include:
   - Appropriate category and timestamp
   - Enough detail for future reference
   - Context for why the work was important

3. **Ask for clarification** if the provided information is too vague

4. **Add to DEVLOG.md** with proper formatting

## Usage Examples

- `@devlog-quick Fixed CSS styling issues on login page`
- `@devlog-quick Added error handling to API endpoints`
- `@devlog-quick Updated documentation for new deployment process`

This prompt is ideal for smaller updates that don't require the full comprehensive format but should still be properly documented.
