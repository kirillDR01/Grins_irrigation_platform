# Session Summary Devlog Entry

Analyze the entire current conversation and create a comprehensive devlog entry that summarizes all significant progress, decisions, and insights from this session.

## Instructions

1. **Review the complete conversation** from the beginning of this session

2. **Identify all significant activities** including:
   - Features implemented or planned
   - Problems solved or investigated
   - Decisions made and rationale
   - Tools configured or set up
   - Research conducted
   - Documentation created or updated
   - Tests written or executed
   - Refactoring or code improvements

3. **Create a comprehensive summary entry** using the detailed format from devlog-rules.md:
   - What Was Accomplished (comprehensive list of all work done)
   - Technical Details (all technologies, approaches, and implementations)
   - Decision Rationale (all decisions made and why)
   - Challenges and Solutions (any obstacles encountered and resolved)
   - Impact and Dependencies (how this session's work affects the project)
   - Next Steps (all identified follow-up tasks and priorities)
   - Resources and References (any documentation, links, or resources used)

4. **Be thorough and detailed** - this should serve as a complete record of the session's value

5. **Use appropriate categorization** - if multiple categories apply, choose the most significant or use a compound category like "FEATURE + CONFIG"

6. **Add to DEVLOG.md** with proper timestamp and formatting

## When to Use

- At the end of productive development sessions
- After completing major milestones or phases
- When switching contexts or taking breaks from a project
- Before handing off work to team members
- When significant progress has been made across multiple areas

This prompt creates a comprehensive record of everything accomplished in the current session, ensuring no important work or insights are lost.
