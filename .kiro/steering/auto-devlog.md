# Automatic Devlog Updates

After completing significant development work, update DEVLOG.md following devlog-rules.md format.

Triggers: implementation, bug fixes, refactoring, API work, DB changes, config/setup, planning, docs.

Process:
1. Use devlog agent: `/agent swap devlog-agent`
2. Follow format in devlog-rules.md
3. INSERT AT TOP — after "## Recent Activity" header
4. Be thorough: technical details, decisions, context
