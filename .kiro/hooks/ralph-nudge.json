Log the timeout in activity.md: 'Task {task-id}: TIMEOUT after 15 minutes'\n2. Try a completely different approach\n3. If no alternative exists, mark task as blocked and continue to next task\n\n🔄 COMMAND TIMEOUT RECOVERY:\nIf you just experienced a command timeout, try these strategies:\n\n1. **npm install timeout**:\n   - Install packages one at a time: npm install pkg1 && npm install pkg2\n   - Use --legacy-peer-deps flag\n   - Skip optional dependencies\n\n2. **shadcn/ui CLI timeout**:\n   - Manually create component files from shadcn/ui source\n   - Copy component code directly\n   - Install dependencies manually\n\n3. **Build/compile timeout**:\n   - Check for infinite loops in code\n   - Reduce scope of changes\n   - Comment out problematic sections temporarily\n\n4. **Test timeout**:\n   - Run specific test file instead of full suite\n   - Skip slow tests temporarily\n   - Increase test timeout in config\n\n5. **General stagnation**:\n   - Skip the problematic step and document it\n   - Continue with next task\n   - Mark current task as blocked\n\n⚠️ CRITICAL: DO NOT wait for user input during autonomous execution.\n\nMake a decision NOW:\n- Try alternative approach (counts as retry attempt)\n- Skip and continue to next task\n- Mark as blocked and document why\n\nThe goal is overnight/unattended execution. Keep moving forward."
