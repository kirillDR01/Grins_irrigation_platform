## Current System/Process Mapping

### Step 1 - Receive Job Requests

First and foremost before anything is started and done, the first step is acquiring job requests. To acquire jobs, Grin's Irrigation receives them through multiple ways which include:

- Existing clients reaching out to Viktor via text or call (MOST COMMON)
- New requests from website and google business page traffic brings either calls or work request form submissions (second most common with google mainly bringing in new work and clients)
- People reach out via word of mouth through texting/calling Viktor, Gennadiy, or Vasiliy. Anything that goes to Gennadiy or Vasiliy is then sent to Viktor for tracking (third most common)
- Friends/business partners requesting work done for their clients (Least common but brings good business)
- NEW DEVELOPMENT: This past year Viktor reached out to existing clients via email or text with seasonal work reminders, promotions they are offering, and new upgrades they are recommending with good results.
- NEW DEVELOPMENT: Following up consistently with leads (people they provided estimates to) has shown good results with people accepting estimates more likely if the team consistently follows up with them.

### Step 2 - Track Job Requests

Once job requests are received, the team categorizes them via two separate sections. These sections include Ready to Schedule and Requires Estimate Prior to Scheduling. Below are the jobs that fall into either category:

**Ready to Schedule:**

- **Seasonal Work:** includes system spring start ups, system summer tune ups, and system fall winterizations. The reason why these jobs are ready to schedule is because they have a base price set up for these services based on zone count so they can give prices over the phone, text or email. For residential systems 10 zones or under they know that spring start ups and summer tune ups on average take 30-60 min to complete and winterizations on average take roughly 30-45 min to complete which includes arrival, service, and payment collection if paid once service is complete (MOST COMMON)
- **Small repair/system update work:** includes jobs where the client knows what is broken/needs to be done or the team can tell what is broken/needs to be done based on what they tell them. For example, if a client says they have two busted sprinkler heads in the front lawn, the team can tell the client that the cost to repair each sprinkler head is $50 over text, call, or email and they know on average they can complete this job in 30 min or less. If price/job needs to be adjusted, they typically adjust on the spot and try to complete it within the allotted time and reschedule if needed (SECOND MOST COMMON).
- **Approved estimates:** includes work that an estimate was given and approved (THIRD MOST COMMON).
- **Deals worked out with partners, HOAs, property managers and builders:** includes work that is pre determined already with existing partners, HOAs, property managers and builders where they have already worked out a deal. In this case they simply call Grin's Irrigation and the team goes and schedules the work without needing to estimate or review projects prior. For example, they have a builder that they work with where they install new systems for all his homes. They worked out a deal where they charge $700 per zone and all of his properties are pretty much the same. So they simply get a text from him that a property is ready for installation and they right away schedule it and once they arrive at the property they quickly count how many zones a system has, install it right after, and send him an invoice (Zone count * $700) that same day. (LEAST COMMON)

**Requires Estimate Prior to Scheduling:**

- **New system installs for new customers:** includes new system installs for new customers where the team wants to meet the customer in person to review work that they want done with their own recommendations. This is where the sale process is mostly key as it is a big ticket job that requires 1 on 1 with clients to build them a system that falls within their budget and needs for their lawn. (MOST COMMON)
- **Work that cannot be determined over standard communication:** includes smaller jobs where the client has ideas of what they want done but the team can't get the full picture over the phone. They typically want to visit the sites prior to doing work as they want to make sure they don't estimate too high or estimate too little. From there they provide an estimate based on 1 on 1 discussion with clients (SECOND MOST COMMON).
- **Issues with a system that can't be figured out over the phone:** includes issues with an existing system where both the client and the team can't figure out what the issue is over the phone. This typically requires them to spend time diagnosing the issues prior to starting. They typically charge $100 for a trip visit here for the first hour of diagnosis and then anything additional will be an hourly charge based on how bad the situation is and what is required to solve it. Once a problem is figured out, they give an estimate to the client (THIRD MOST COMMON).
- **New HOAs, property managers, and builders:** includes work needed to be done for new HOAs, property managers, and builders where the team wants to visit the property or properties to provide an estimate/work out a deal for the future.

Once job requests are categorized in these two categories, the team tracks these requests within their spreadsheet via three main tabs which includes:

**Job Requests Tab:**

- **People who submitted requests from traffic via google page, website, or word of mouth:** Includes people that submitted requests via their google form for selected services (MOST COMMON).
- **New customers who they requested to submit forms to gather their data:** includes new customers that called over the phone that requested work. They mainly have them submit the form to gather their data. (SECOND MOST COMMON).
- **Existing customers who have new work requests that they want to make sure the team tracks:** includes existing customers who they have told to submit new requests for new properties or new work that is needed so that they can track their requests efficiently instead of trying to track their requests via text messages or calls and then manually typing their request in within the spreadsheet. Not everyone does this but it really helps them during the busy season. (THIRD MOST COMMON MOST COMMON).
- **Existing customers for seasonal service reminders:** includes existing customers that submit requests from mass emails that they started sending out about seasonal service reminders. (NEW DEVELOPMENT)
- **New customers from various ads:** includes new customers that may come from ads that they put in mail or elsewhere. (LEAST COMMON)

Note: This tab gets automatically populated from google form submissions. No tracking is done via this tab as it's constantly getting updated from google form submissions. Requests from this tab are grabbed and moved to either Tracking Tab or Leads Tab. Viktor reviews this tab daily for new requests.

**Tracking Tab:**

- **Tracks all approved job requests:** within this tab, Viktor copies and pastes all approved job requests.
- **Tracks customer contact info and location:** all main customer data that is immediately needed to schedule a job is filtered and shown (Name, Phone Number, Email, City, Address). This is so Viktor can see just what he needs to contact the client and map the job out from the location.
- **Tracks job type and notes:** The job type column is used to track the type of job so that Viktor can estimate rough time needed to complete this job. Viktor also likes to add customer notes within this column.
- **Tracks job status:** The job status column is used to track what is needed to be done with this job. Jobs needed to be scheduled are marked "Schedule" and highlighted red. Jobs scheduled and in process are labeled "Pending Completion" and highlighted yellow. Jobs completed are labeled "Completed" and highlighted green.
- **Tracks payment status:** The "Payment Amount Due" column is used to track the amount that is owed to them. The "Invoices Status" column is used to track status of invoice. If it's marked "Send Invoice" and highlighted in pink Viktor needs to send an invoice. If marked with a date and highlighted in yellow it has been sent and pending collection. If it is marked with "Reminded" and highlighted red that means its past due and reminder is needed. If it is marked "N/A" and not highlighted, that means payment has been collected or no collection is needed. Viktor uses the "Amount Paid" column to track how much has been paid.

Note: This tab is all manually updated. This is where the main tracking gets done and Viktor reviews this tab daily. The colors help him to quickly understand what needs to be done without reading text.

**Leads Tab:**

- **Leads that need estimates from form requests:** includes requests for systems installs, updates, repairs that they need to provide an estimate for.

Note: This tab all needs to be manually updated and Viktor sometimes does not update it due to being very busy. Within, he mainly just focused on the last contact date and notes from the latest conversion which are the last two columns. Please disregard the colors, Viktor already forgot what they mean. He reviews this tab weekly to see who he needs to follow up with.

**Other tabs that are not used regularly but exist include:**

- **Spring 2026 tab:** includes requests from clients that expressed wanting to do work next spring
- **Yearly winterization tab:** Includes clients that requested to be contacted yearly to complete winterization
- **Yearly spring start up tab:** Includes clients that requested to be contacted yearly to complete spring start up
- **Yearly summer tune up tab:** Includes clients that requested to be contacted yearly to complete summer tune up
- **Raw data tab:** Simply a tab that is used to copy raw data from the job requests tab and paste within the raw data tab in case customer data gets lost within any of the previous tabs.
- **Red flag tab:** List of clients that the team either doesn't want to work with or can't work with due to client circumstances so they want to avoid contacting them.
- **People that take a while to pay tab:** Simply people that take a while to pay that they need to find a solution to fix that issue.
- **Customer contact list tab:** Simply a tab that only includes customer contact information to be used to put in various apps or websites to contact a lot of clients fast.

Note: These tabs all need to be manually updated and Viktor often does not update them due to being very busy. These tabs are rarely used but are there to help not miss out on jobs and store data. All other tabs in red highlight please disregard as it's old data that is not really needed but kept for potential future reference when needed to locate old customer data.

### Step 3 - Schedule Job Requests

Once jobs are categorized in the various tabs above, it's time to schedule these jobs so that they can be completed. Jobs are scheduled based on these factors:

- **Location:** Jobs are filtered per city to batch jobs close to each other. This allows the team to be more efficient with their time by cutting down total drive time between cities. Viktor typically filters the approved jobs requests via the color red so he can know which ones need to be scheduled. From there he filters the city tab so that he can batch requests in the same city.
- **Job type:** Job type is the next factor that is considered to determine time needed for the appointment slot. Typically all service requests are batched together (start ups, summer tune ups, and winterizations), all repairs are batched together, all major system updates or new installations are batched together, and all landscaping jobs are batched together.
- **Estimated time to complete:** They estimate roughly how long they think the job will take based on various factors. These factors include the job type, zone count, and system type (commercial or residential). This is figured out in Viktor's head and not written down anywhere.
- **When a request was made:** They work on a first come first serve basis so they like to for the most part schedule jobs following that principle. If person A requests a spring start up before person B, person A should get done before person B with a 2-4 day buffer. What Viktor means by a 2-4 day buffer is this: Let's say they are in Plymouth doing spring start ups next monday and they have slots available on monday in Plymouth and they are in Rogers doing spring start ups on Thursday with slots available. If person A who is in Rogers filled out a request before Person B who is in Plymouth, Viktor would put person B in front of person A.
- **Time in the season:** Typically there are two main busy times in the season which include spring with spring start ups and fall with fall winterizations. Typically during these busy times they like to focus on these jobs during the busy times as it allows them to service their existing customers and take on new customers that can bring them more work in the future. Major repair/update jobs, new system installs, or landscaping work are done later in the season unless they are able to get them to pay a higher rate than usual.

Once the above factors are reviewed, Viktor starts to map out the jobs on google calendar. When a request is made and the time in the season is typically considered first. After which Viktor likes to batch the jobs per the job type. All service requests (spring start ups, summer tune ups, winterizations) are batched together, all minor repair work or minor update work is batched together, all major repair work and major update work is batched together, all new system installs are batched together, and all landscaping work is batched together. There are a few reasons why Viktor batches these jobs together which include:

- **Staffing:** Each job type requires a different amount of man power. Service requests and minor repair/update work can typically be done with one person. Major repair and update work typically requires 2 people for the job, and new system installs and landscaping work typically requires 2-4 people depending on system factors (how large, complications with ground, complexity). This is the biggest factor.
- **Equipment needed:** Some jobs require different types of equipment. They would not want to haul around equipment for no reason for half the day or waste time going to store the equipment mid day. The jobs that require equipment are new system installs (pipe puller and utility trailer), landscaping jobs (pipe puller, skid steer with attachments, utility trailer, and or dump trailer), winterizations (compressor), and sometimes major repair/update work (pipe puller and utility trailer). This is the second biggest factor.
- **Materials needed:** Big landscaping jobs and new system installs typically require large amounts of materials purchased. Hauling a full load of materials on a trailer or within a van/truck when you have a full day of service work makes it really difficult to work out of that vehicle. This is the third biggest factor but typically does not need to be considered often as the problem is already addressed through one of the above factors.

Once the above factors are considered, Viktor considers the last two factors which are location and estimated time to complete. As discussed previously, they want to reduce the travel time between cities and knock out as many service appointments as possible during the busy times in the season. To get a basic level understanding on how Viktor thinks, let's say it's spring and they have 50 start ups, 10 minor repairs or updates, 4 major repairs or updates, 1 system install, 1 large landscaping project. Since it's spring time, Viktor focuses on getting Vas and his Dad on getting through the spring start ups first. He pulls the location of the spring start ups and puts them together and reviews how many spring start ups they have per location. Let's say they have 20 in Eden Prairie, 10 in Plymouth, 10 in Maple Grove, 5 in Brooklyn Park, 5 in Rogers. Each system is reviewed for how many zones they have roughly and what type of system it is to determine rough amount of time needed to complete (is it a standard system that grabs water from home or a system that grabs water from lake, also is it a commercial system with a large amount of land or is it a standard small land residential system). Let's say if it is a standard residential system, it should take 30-60 min. If it is a large commercial system with a lake pump it takes 60-120 min. Only a small percentage of their systems are not standard residential systems so let's say they can complete 10 start ups in a day. Now Viktor starts adding the jobs to the calendar per the above information. He really doesn't account for any factors when it comes to plotting a city to a specific day of the week but he likes to spread it out as much as possible in case new requests come in. For example it doesn't really make a difference if he puts Eden Prairie on Monday or on Saturday. He would plot 20 Eden Prairie appointments on Monday (10 for Vas and 10 for Dad) and within these calendar slots he would add job type, client name, client number, and client address. He would also use a route optimizer and plug in all addresses on the route optimizer to get the best route possible. On Tuesday he would plot 10 in Plymouth for Vas/Dad (doesn't matter) and 10 Maple Grove for Vas/Dad. On Wednesday, they now have half the day open. He would plot 5 Brooklyn Park appointments first and then the 5 Rogers appointments after for either Vas or Dad. If working on appointments in different cities, they like to go in one direction so if they start in Brooklyn Park, they move in one direction after which in this case is up to Rogers. Let's say minor repairs/updates take roughly 60-120 min to complete and the 5 minor repairs and updates they have are in various cities. Viktor would fill Vas's Wednesday up with those 5 minor repair jobs with 2 hour slots each to account for potential travel time. Let's say the major repairs/updates take two people 2-4 hours to complete. Viktor would book Vas and Dad with 2 major repair/update jobs on a Thursday with the two that are closest to each other. Let's say system installs take 1 day each with 2-4 people needed and the landscaping projects take 2 days to complete with 2-4 people and they need to get both done asap. In that case, Viktor would also book the other two major repairs/updates jobs on Thursday and go out there himself with Steven to get them done. That leaves Viktor, Vas, his Dad and Steven to complete 1 install on Friday and then start the landscaping project on Saturday and finish Monday.

Note: There are cases where they may put different types of work together or put an install in front of start ups which includes the following examples:

- Needing to get a minor repair done in order to start a system may require them to have a full day of spring start ups mixed with minor repair jobs.
- Specialty clients like a builder they built a long relationship with may need them to get a system install done asap so they may do his project first even though they already have a list of spring start ups to do during spring time.
- If they got behind on schedule and didn't get to finish the job, they could add that job with other job types to finish and not push off.
- Sometimes during start ups there might be minor work that needs to be done like replacing a sprinkler head. If they have time, they may complete that job while they are there instead of rescheduling the repair work for the future. If it's major work, they reschedule for the future.
- Simply having an open schedule that needs to be filled may require them to mix job types and locations. For example, late in the winterization season, they may literally drive around multiple different cities just to fill their schedule.
- Let's say they have a very large amount of start ups that need to be done and they also have system installs they need to have done at the same time. Because Vas knows how to use the machine the best, Viktor may send him off in the morning to use the machine to pull in pipes with Steven while Viktor covers his spring start up appointments in the morning. As soon as Vas is done, they switch off and Vas works through spring start ups for the rest of the day while Viktor continues the system install with Steven and potentially even calls Vitallik for backup if needed.
- Emergency repairs are sometimes needed for lawns that may have new sod/plants that need to get watered so they may mix these with start ups.

Some additional factors to consider are the following:

- Viktor likes to typically book out one week at a time. What he means by that is he would not book week 2 until week 1 is fully booked so that they can maximize utilization.
- Weather can impact start dates for major projects like system installs and major landscaping projects. They try their best to work around the weather by scheduling jobs that don't really get impacted by weather like start ups on rainy days and jobs that get impacted by weather on non rainy days. Another case where weather can impact is in the fall where they could have random flash freezes. Let's say they have a request to get an install done in the fall while they have winterizations to get done. They may push off the install to get done later so that they can get all the winterizations done before the flash freeze.
- Viktor likes to always have at least 1 person available to mostly focus on small appointments. They typically choose his dad for this. They also typically like to have at least 1-2 people available for major jobs like big repairs/updates/installs/landscaping and this is typically a mix of Vas, Steven, or Vitallik. Then they like to have 1 person mostly to manage customer requests, problems with appointments with the other, and estimates/scheduling which is typically Viktor.

Once these jobs are mapped out for the week, Viktor reaches out to all clients individually to schedule these appointments. In a perfect world, all clients would be available during the times they give them but that is not always the case. If clients are not available, they try their best to find a way to still be able to complete the job without the clients being home. If still not possible, they push to the following week. To help avoid this as much as possible, they request clients to give availability in requests so that they can schedule as close to their availability as possible. Once the client says yes to the time they give them, Viktor sets the color of the appointment on the google calendar based on who will be assigned to complete that appointment. For example, on Monday Vas may be assigned the color red. From there Viktor goes back in the tracking tab and flips the appointment from needing to schedule highlighted in Red to scheduled highlighted in yellow. Now the job is scheduled and they go get the job done.

### Step 4 - Complete Job Requests

To complete a job request it first starts off from the person reviewing their schedule for the day and following these steps:

**Step 1 - grab what's needed to complete the jobs:** Typically they like to make sure all vehicles are restocked weekly so they minimize the time needed to grab additional materials if needed. All smaller jobs typically do not require to grab anything as the vehicles are already stocked with the basic materials and tools needed to complete the job. By reviewing the schedule, the person can typically see if there are any specialty jobs that require specialty tools/equipment. For example, a system install will require grabbing a larger quantity of materials for the job and grabbing the pipe puller utility trailer. If materials have not already been bought previously, the person would need to pick them up before starting the day.

**Step 2 - Go to job and complete:** Within this step the person reviews the schedule and starts off with the first job of the day. If there is only one job that day, the person focuses on that job. If clients are home, the person will notify the client of their arrival but knock on the door and start the job.

**Step 3 - Discuss additional work with client (if needed):** If additional work is needed outside of the original plan, work and price is discussed with client prior to completing additional work to gain client approval.

**Step 4 - Show client completed work and collect payment if possible:** Once work is completed, person will show the client completed work and try to collect payment on the spot

**Step 5 - Update appointment slot on the calendar:** Once work is completed and shown to client, within the appointment slot in the calendar, there is a notes section that can be used to write notes about the project. The main notes that are written from the person on the job include the following:

- Completion status of the job (Either complete, started, or needs to be rescheduled)
- Payment status (either amount paid or needs an invoice)
- Information on future work needed or requests (If they want other services or estimates on additional work)
- System details including zone type, system type (commercial/residential and standard or lakepump), system size, system complications
- Additional information about client or whatever else that may seem important to remember

**Step 6 - Move on to the next client:** Once all the previous steps are completed, the person moves on to the next appointment/job. If late or early, the person will notify Viktor to reach out to the client and confirm if that is okay. Once arriving at the next job, the person will follow the same steps.

Note: here are some factors to consider during this process that impact job completion:

- Client not being home or forgetting about appointment
- Missing the materials needed to complete the job
- Needing to reschedule if the job has unexpected complications
- Being late or early to other jobs and clients are not there
- Missing an appointment due to the scheduling being jam packed on the calendar and the person simply misses an appointment on accident even though they are on time

### Step 5 - Close Job Requests

Once the team goes through an appointment, the next step would be for Viktor to go through all the notes from the day and review all that has been written within. If he sees anything that is missing or he doesn't understand, he has to reach out to the person that completed the job to gather any remaining information that he needs. Once all the information he needs is gathered, all jobs requests gone through that day are categorized into the following:

- **Job complete and paid:** The job has been completed and paid on the spot and there is nothing additional needed here. (MOST COMMON)
- **Job complete but not paid:** The job has been completed but not paid for so an invoice will need to be written out and sent out to the client to collect payment. (SECOND MOST COMMON)
- **Job needs to be rescheduled to complete:** This will include jobs that had complications that caused the job to need to be rescheduled. (NOT AS COMMON)
- **Job that needs estimate:** Include jobs that were thought to be more simple but ended up being more complicated that needs a written estimate. (LEAST COMMON)

Once categorized, Viktor updates the spreadsheet mainly within the tracking tab. For jobs complete and paid, he updates the job status column to "Completed" and highlights in green and updates the payment information (amount due to $0, N/A invoice, and amount paid based on notes). For jobs complete and not paid, he updates the job status column to "Completed" and highlights in green and updates the payment information columns (amount due to whatever is due, Invoice sent date to the following date and colored yellow, and amount paid to $0). He then manually writes the invoice via a template and sends the invoice the following day via text. Jobs that need to be rescheduled he updates the job status column to "need to schedule" and highlights in red. He may also write a note that this is a rescheduled job so that he could prioritize rescheduling it. Jobs that need an estimate typically have basic estimate notes from the person that was there. Viktor takes these notes and writes an estimate for the client and typically sends them the estimate the following day via text. He removes the job request from the tracking tab and pastes in the leads tab. Within there he adds notes from the previous visit on the estimate and estimate sent date.

The only people that need to be followed up with from there are people that have not paid their invoice and people that got sent an estimate but have not responded. Viktor reviews the invoices and estimates sections once a week and compares the sent date to the current date. Since all his invoices have a two week due date (unless it's a special case like big corporations that typically pay a month later), he highlights all past due invoices in red and follows up weekly via text or call about payment until it's complete. Once complete, he updates payment information (amount due to $0, N/A invoice, and amount paid based on notes). The estimates he likes to follow up a week after the first sent date, then two week follow up periods after that until he either gets a yes or no.

Note: There is some additional information that may be reviewed and typed within the spreadsheet. Unfortunately Viktor sometimes forgets to add these items within the spreadsheet but it includes:

- Client requesting to be put on a contact list yearly for seasonal service. Viktor would typically add these clients to one of the three seasonal service tabs and contact them when they start completing those seasonal services.
- If clients request additional work, Viktor typically manually inputs a new request for the work that will either need to have an estimate or need to be scheduled.
- Any complications with clients that lead them to not want to work with the clients again Viktor typically adds to the red flag tab in the spreadsheet.
- Any complications with payment Viktor typically adds these clients to the tab of people that take a while to pay.
- Any additional notes for a client for the future may be input into the original line item request in the spreadsheet.

That is the complete process/system, from start to finish. The system has worked well but has plenty of areas that can be automated and/or improved which will be detailed in the following sections of this document.

## System/Process Issues and Success Encountered

Within this section, information is provided regarding issues the team encounters along with where/what they found success within the complete process. The best way to do this is to go through each process step and detail what can create chaos, waste time, and or lose money.

### Step 1 - Receive Job Requests

**Problems:**

- **Tracking calls, texts, and or emails:** Job requests need constant attention and availability to respond to and track. During the busy times in the season, so many requests come in that the team naturally loses jobs due to missing calls or responding late, leading to the risk of clients finding other options quicker. Not to mention, the constant need of answering calls, responding to texts is very tedious and takes a lot of time out of the day during the busy season. This is particularly a problem when needing to focus time and energy on other tasks at hand. (BIGGEST ISSUE)

  A current way that Viktor handles this is through text messages, using the google work request form, and or jotting down quick notes via the notes app on the phone/mac. For example, when a client calls Viktor doesn't have the time to jot down conversations between him and the client and his memory is not good enough to remember 20-30 conversations over the phone he had with clients at the end of the day. After the conversation, he either requests the client to send him the request/summary of what they want via text or he asks them to fill out the work request form. The only time he really puts things in his notes is if he knows the client is old for example or calling from a landline so they can't really send him a text. Simply requesting the client to shoot him a text of that information over to him and him not opening their messages until he has the ability to address it allows him to keep track of what needs further action and what doesn't. Anything that has been opened and read through means that it has been addressed and any text that is not opened or read through is pending further action. Naturally Viktor sometimes accidentally opens a message without realizing it and does not respond to clients. Mainly he does this for clients that have items that need to be addressed that don't require to schedule anything (for example a client wants him to provide them his commercial insurance). The work request form works in a similar fashion but it's used in a case where they need to schedule an appointment for a work request.

- **Sorting good clients out from bad:** There isn't really a way for Viktor to sort good clients from bad clients over call or text. This is not ideal as they take in all that they sometimes miss out on bigger paying clients that are way better to work with than other customers.

- **Trouble filling out or accessing the work request form:** Some clients mention issues with accessing the work request form or outright don't feel like filling out a work request form. Sometimes but very rarely this leads to clients just calling someone else.

- **Loss of information:** Sometimes names, clients address, or other information is lost after conversations.

- **Needing to create a contact in the phone:** Wastes a lot of time updating contact information for new clients and it is especially frustrating when the phone is glitchy/slow due to the high volume of texts coming in.

- **Useless conversations/requests:** There are times when people text Viktor about random items that he needs to spend time responding to. For example, asking to send them invoices again, or asking for job documentation that has already been sent via text/email, or basic information about their system that was already previously explained but they forgot. These items take up time and are annoying to deal with during a hectic day.

- **Responding to mass texts/emails responses:** It is frustrating when Viktor sends mass emails out or mass texts out and clients respond to the texts/emails instead of filling out the forms. Next thing you know his phone is buzzing non stop and it's hard to keep track of.

- **Filling out of work request forms wrong:** Sometimes clients fill the work request form out wrong which leads to wasting time trying to correct it. Let's say a new client calls Viktor asking for something and Viktor sends him a work request form and forgets to update their name into his contact list. They fill out the work request form and type their phone number wrong or forget to add a number. When he goes to contact them, the number is not in service. Now he has to manually go through all his texts and try to find a number that matches close to the number they filled out. Or sometimes people just straight up request all services at once because they don't pay attention. When he asks them if they really want all services at once, they say "No I just want one service".

- **Trouble getting people to fill out work request forms:** Some people see the work request form and say "I don't want to fill it out". Super annoying and sometimes Viktor just has to allow them to be like that and type in all their information manually.

**Success:**

- **Communication:** Clients have expressed really liking quick communication with a real human. Many have said either they call other companies, leave messages and don't get a response or they talk with a prerecorded human which they don't like. Viktor literally got a big paying client that went with him just because he really liked how Viktor responded quickly and texted him consistently through the process of refurbishing his system. (PS: This client is also really big into AI and has started his own AI start up and Viktor would like all three of them to have a meal within the next month or two).

- **Work request form:** The team has used the work request form to eliminate lots of repeat work request calls (seasonal service) and even new work request calls (repairs, new install, update work) with existing clients. They have asked them to use the work request form which they gave them a link to or a QR code to and they simply just fill it out when they need something done instead of calling them knowing that the team will respond to their request by the next day. Unfortunately not all clients do this and some just don't like to fill out a form all the time instead of just texting Viktor "Can you come fix this broken pipe?".

- **Mass emails/texts about seasonal service:** This year Viktor tried sending out mass emails/texts reminding people about seasonal service in advance and it helped him address all of their existing clients a month before the craziness would get out of hand. All their existing clients are happy that they got their service done on time and were prioritized and the team was able to start early allowing them to have more time to take in more new clients.

### Step 2 - Track Job Requests

**Problems:**

- **Wasting time manually typing/updating everything:** Manually needing to track and type everything has to be Viktor's biggest waste of time. He lives in the spreadsheet during the season always updating new job requests, existing ones, and closing requests out. He wastes so much time here it's insane.

- **Forgetting to update important information or missing information:** There are many times when it's so busy that Viktor either doesn't type enough information about a job or a client or straight up forgets to update something. This ends up biting him in the butt down the road. For example, he forgets to add a note that a client is old and does not have a cell phone (calls from landline). He shoots him a text, doesn't get a response and forgets about him. Next thing you know he calls Viktor asking when they will be there. Another example, a client moves states and asks to not be contacted again. Viktor forgets to remove them from the customer contact list and contacts them again and they get upset. Another example, a client has big dogs that are a risk to staff and they forget to ask them to keep dogs inside on arrival.

- **Needing internet to pull information:** Sometimes when Viktor is out somewhere and doesn't have internet, he can't pull information that he might need due to the spreadsheet requiring internet to use.

- **Not easy for other people to read and understand:** It's Viktor's system and it works how he designed it. He only looks for and has information that is important to him. When Vas looked through it, he could not understand it and did not know how to use the spreadsheet. Viktor didn't even try to get his dad to use it because he knew he would fail using it.

- **Very difficult to use with a phone:** Not optimized for the phone whatsoever. Viktor needs to carry his MacBook around to go through it fast.

**Success:**

- **Simplicity is key:** Viktor found the more simple it is to get the main information he needs, the better. Last year he had 4-5 main tabs that he used. This year there are 2-3 main tabs which are the first two tabs. Colors also help a lot and allow easy tracking. Simplicity also allows it to be very very easy to use. This allowed him to handle tracking more information at once allowing higher intake of customers.

- **Single source of truth:** Having a central source of truth is great for pulling information when everything is there. Need an address, it's there, need information about the job, it's there. For example, someone told Viktor they over paid him for work. He reviewed all the work they did for them and found that they did not over pay for any work and explained to him all the jobs that they did for him the past two years and the amount he paid. He then confirmed they were correct and apologized.

- **Work request form saves time:** When clients fill out work request forms, it saves time from Viktor needing to manually type in all their information. They fill it out themselves and boom it pops up on his end.

### Step 3 - Schedule Job Requests

**Problems:**

- **Wasting time manually sorting through jobs and typing them into the calendar:** Viktor spends a lot of time trying to look through the jobs in the spreadsheet, estimate rough time to complete, and create individual slots in the calendar/typing all the required information. It takes a lot of time to type 20-30 jobs into the calendar for one day. During the winterization season, there are 150+ individual jobs per week with 5+ min per job to schedule from start to finish.

- **Waste time individually texting clients about appointment times:** A lot of time is wasted sending clients times they can come to complete their appointments. It requires Viktor to find their number, type the message template, and update the times for them. Then he has to wait until they confirm and then go back into the calendar and mark the appointment as confirmed.

- **Customers not being available during the times:** It really sucks when Viktor spends time getting the schedule optimized, types pending appointments into the calendar, texts the client, just for them to say they are not available. That leads him to try to find something that will fit into their schedule or even have to re-contact some clients asking if they can move their appointment to fill that spot so their route can be somewhat efficient. He really does not like needing to spend time in this process.

- **Incorrect or missing information in appointment slots:** Sometimes Viktor simply makes mistakes in the calendar slots and that leads to the staff either going to the wrong addresses, not having key information they need to complete the job, not being able to connect with clients, and so on. That leads them to need to call Viktor to figure out an issue and wasting time waiting until the issue is figured out by him.

- **Staff getting their routes mixed up:** Sometimes staff get their routes mixed up. Viktor tries to distinguish between routes with colors but sometimes they still mess it up because on their phone it may not be easy to read in some cases and two different staff show up at the same address meaning one staff did not go to the correct appointment and is now late for his next appointment.

- **Google brings up incorrect addresses:** Sometimes when you update the address into google calendar, it brings up the wrong address. Unfortunately they don't know it's wrong until it's too late and they show up to the wrong address.

- **Being too late/too early:** Sometimes staff are too late or too early and they don't notify Viktor nor the clients of that. Clients start calling asking where they are or clients are not home when staff arrive. This throws off the schedule for the rest of the day and they need to spend time trying to find a way to get back on track.

- **Staff asking Viktor to contact clients about their appointment slots:** Sometimes staff have issues with clients not answering the door or their phone. Next thing you know, the staff are calling Viktor asking what to do while he's busy with another task.

- **Clients forgetting about appointments and not being home on arrival:** They don't really remind clients in advance of their appointments nor do they remind them if they are on their way. If Viktor books something a week in advance, he doesn't have time to contact the clients again to remind them of their appointments. Next thing you know they show up and clients are not home because they forgot about their appointments.

**Success:**

- **Giving clients appropriate time slots:** Typically giving clients a 2 hour time slot has helped stay on track with the schedule and clients being home during that 2 hour time window. If a job takes 1 hour, a two hour time slot gives enough to complete the job and a 1 hour buffer in case the job takes longer than expected. For example, Viktor tells one client they will be there between 10-12 and the next client they will be there between 11-1. If a staff finishes the first job on time, he gets to the next client at 11 which is on time. If it takes an hour longer than expected, he shows up at 12 giving him the chance to make up his time.

- **Giving a clear schedule to follow to staff (when all correct):** When staff have a clear and well put together schedule, they go through the day very efficiently and don't need to rush anything. They maximize the amount of jobs they can do in a day and Viktor doesn't get any calls from staff about any issues.

- **Efficient routes (when all correct):** Efficient routes give more room to add more jobs in a day increasing profits.

- **Notes about specific appointments in the calendar:** Being able to update information about the job or client in the notes section of the calendar is a great add on. It allows them to reference information about the job that they need when they arrive. It just sucks that Viktor needs to manually take that info from the calendar and input it into the spreadsheet or the opposite (taking info from spreadsheet and putting it into the calendar).

- **Asking clients for availability ahead of time:** Asking clients to provide their availability for a given week when they fill out the work request form or text them allows them to avoid clients saying they won't be available when they give them a time.

- **Simplicity:** Again, simplicity is key to track important information for staff and Viktor when going through a route on the calendar. He tries to keep it as simple as possible.

### Step 4 - Complete Job Requests

**Problems:**

- **Client not being home or taking a while to answer the door:** Happens almost everyday with at least one client. Staff arrives and either they are not home or not answering the door leading to staff sitting there for 10-20 min waiting on what to do or waiting for a client to arrive.

- **Missing materials to complete job:** Sometimes staff arrive and don't have the materials they need to complete the job or they ran out of materials at the previous job. Leads to either needing Viktor to go there and drop off materials, the staff leaving to go get materials at a local supplier, or needing to reschedule the job.

- **Unexpected bills to clients:** Sometimes clients expected one thing and got additional repair work on the bill that the team didn't let them know about that needed to be done to complete the job. They don't charge for no reason but sometimes this happens and most of the time it's fine but sometimes clients are upset about it.

- **Clients not knowing about price updates in recurring work:** Sometimes clients get confused why their prices rose and the team didn't notify them of the price increase. Most of the time it's fine but then you get the few that are upset about it when the staff tell them the total at the end.

- **Collecting payment on the spot:** Sometimes staff don't have the ability to collect payment on the spot, leading Viktor to have to manually write invoices for them. Or clients want to pay but only have a credit card, which they don't take. Also it takes time out of the day for staff to have to wait for clients to answer the door again to collect the payment (at least 5-10 minutes).

- **Missed information in calendar notes:** Sometimes staff are rushing and forget to add information about the job in the notes or simply don't put enough info in the notes for Viktor. This leads him to need to go to them and ask about this information wasting time at the end of the day.

- **Being late or early to the next appointment:** As stated before, being late or early to appointments without notifying clients creates upset clients or leads to them losing time during the day if clients are not home.

- **Staff not remembering what they charge clients for work (if Needed):** Sometimes staff don't know what to charge for jobs so they have to reach out to Viktor. He has to waste time telling them or figuring out a price with them. Or they overcharge/undercharge them.

- **Incorrect calendar information:** As stated before, incorrect calendar information leads to staff calling Viktor asking and him wasting time trying to figure out correct information.

- **Clients looking for discounts after work is complete:** Clients asking for discounts on the spot are super annoying and sucks to deal with during a busy day.

- **Unexpected job complications:** Sometimes jobs are more complicated than expected and it leads to staff sometimes not looking at the time while fixing an issue and not realizing they probably should have rescheduled that work. This leads to them being late for the next jobs and throws off the schedule for the day.

- **Not being able to sign agreements/contracts on the spot with a client:** Sometimes there is additional work that is needed while they are there. The customer may approve verbally but does not sign anything. Thankfully they've never had an issue with clients paying for this additional work but Viktor feels like it will happen in the future.

- **Forgetting to collect reviews:** If staff see that they had a positive interaction with a client, they have a chance to collect a review as they see 1000+ plus people a year. Unfortunately staff don't ask for a review most of the time missing out on boosting their google page.

- **Staff misunderstanding the assignment:** Sometimes there are certain procedures that they need to follow with certain jobs or clients. Sometimes staff don't realize this either because they forgot or because Viktor forgot to tell them and it leads to confusions and complications with the client and the job.

**Success:**

- **Upselling clients:** Upselling clients on the job helps increase money earned. They take advantage of the trip to try to sell them on doing more.

- **Charging for diagnostic time:** They typically have a trip charge that they charge for just arriving and taking a look at an issue. Charging additional hourly helps not waste hours trying to figure out an issue that is complicated. Clients get clear info on what they are charged and they get paid extra.

- **Calendar notes:** Staff updating calendar notes allows them to have info to reference to in the future about the job or client.

- **Collecting payment on the spot:** Anything that helps not having to manually write an invoice helps save Viktor time in the future.

- **Communication to clients:** Walking clients through issues, what is needed to fix it, and notifying them about price has been great to do. Clients expressed they really like that. Also if they are late or early for jobs, clients really like to be notified of that.

### Step 5 - Close Job Requests

**Problems:**

- **Manually going through everything:** Manually having to go through all the calendar notes and updating the spreadsheet is a huge waste of time as mentioned before.

- **Needing to manually write invoices/estimates:** Having to grab a template and type in all the information about a client and then sending them the invoice wastes a lot of time.

- **Needing to contact clients about past due invoices/estimates:** Having to look through past due invoices or estimates not responded to and contacting all the people individually wastes time.

- **Clients not paying:** Dealing with clients not wanting to pay or straight up ignoring them is super annoying when trying to collect payments. Ruins the mood and wastes precious time during the busy season.

- **Missing information:** Staff forgetting to let Viktor know of key information leads to confusion and complications with clients and jobs in the future. Or Viktor forgetting to add key information into the spreadsheet/throughout the spreadsheet also causes complications down the road. For example, a client's address might change and Viktor will update that info in the main tab, but he may not update that in other tabs leading to potentially grabbing the wrong address in the future.

- **Tracking Online Payments:** When tracking online payments via Venmo or Zelle, Viktor has the problem of clients not telling him when they paid. Thus, he needs to go through all of it throughout the week to see if any people paid which wastes a lot of time and oftentimes he misses payments and asks the client for money when they already paid. In addition, they sometimes may pay with names that are not familiar so he got a payment but doesn't know who actually paid.

**Success:**

- **Simplicity:** Again, keeping this process as simple as possible has helped avoid some of the issues mentioned above.

- **Updating the source of truth:** Having an updated source of truth in the spreadsheet allows them to reference any information that they need in the future.

### Other

Below are other items that Viktor found that he wanted to improve but are not necessarily part of the process right now:

- **No automated marketing/advertising:** There are times where they are crazy busy and then there are times where they don't have much work. There is no way to keep the lead flow consistent or increase it automatically.

- **Poor website design with no landing pages:** Website design is very poor and could cause a bad first impression to clients.

- **No automated way to request reviews:** They consistently forget to request reviews which is the main thing that generates lead flow.

- **No diagrams or proof of concept for estimates:** After talking with clients, simply send them an estimate with a price. There is nothing to show clients why they charge what they charge or what they will do leading to customers not really knowing what they are buying. Viktor had a client straight up say, "I thought you were just installing one or two sprinkler heads in the front yard" but they installed 8 heads instead.

- **Clients contacting them again and again for the same services:** Existing clients contact them again and again for seasonal services which is good but annoying as they have to have the same conversations over and over again.

- **Contracts/terms and conditions:** No terms and conditions or contracts that can be used to quickly shoot over to clients to review, sign, and approve. If a contract is written, it's all manually written and takes up a lot of time to review it and go through it.

- **Accounting tracking:** There is no way for them to really keep track of their accounting or even understanding their profit margins without manually calculating all the information.

## System/Process Wants & Needs

Based on the process and the issues/success found within the process from the past two years, Viktor wanted to provide information on what he believes would help improve this so that they are more efficient. If they can get it to the point where they automate it as much as possible to the point where it's stupid simple for managers like Viktor to manage staff and customers, staff can have all the info they need to complete job requests without Viktor even talking to them, and clients can easily request work/accept work/pay, that would be amazing. Below are ideas Viktor has to be able to achieve this.

### Step 1 - Receive Job Requests

- **AI responding to all inquiries/requests and doing it right away:** Tracking requests is very difficult and tedious especially in the busy season. It requires Viktor to have conversations with clients that could take long, intake information, and type that information within the spreadsheet. A lot of time is wasted here that could be automated. Some clients have expressed that they like talking to a real person but Viktor feels like they can have an option where they can talk to a real person like him if they request it. Kind of like calling the IT department of T-Mobile and it's all automated responses until you say "Speak to a representative". If they can have AI pretty much take in client requests from all sources (text, call, email, website), respond to them right away, and lead them to the appropriate landing pages, that would help save time. Viktor doesn't want a human to talk to a person until someone shows up at the door to do the job.

- **Customer portal/information intake:** If they can have it set up where customers use a very simple portal to set up an account, that would be very helpful to track all clients. They can type in all their information that the team needs themselves and they have a way to send work requests or update information if needed, that would save a lot of time from them manually typing/updating their information in. This is kind of like the work request form but customers would only need to type their personal information once. Once they type it in once, on the team's end they see this customer that is set up. The customer can then request work through the portal and sign up for seasonal services eliminating the need for Viktor to contact existing customers for seasonal work, reduce the calls coming in from the same customers, and automate the intake processes. This will also reduce the likelihood of them forgetting to update key information as the customer is required to update that information themselves. Also having a guest option would be great for new customers that just want to try their service out. This would not require them to type in as much information but would still allow them to see this client on their end. This is for the lazy customers giving them an option to be lazy. IT WOULD BE GREAT TO HAVE A TERMS AND CONDITIONS PAGE THAT CUSTOMERS NEED TO SIGN BEFORE ANY WORK IS DONE.

- **Standard service offering on site for customers:** There are a lot of clients during the busy season asking about service prices and next availability. Viktor has to explain to them prices and availability and only then they decide what they want to do. If they can have a service offering an estimated availability to clients and views on their site that gets automatically updated based on jobs that need to be scheduled/are scheduled, that would help save time from needing to provide that. If they include different tier offerings, that could also attract higher paying customers and weed out the trash customers.

- **Landing pages:** It would be great to have landing pages that AI can lead to when customers have questions about service offerings, prices, questions about their system and how to use it, and more. This will eliminate wasting time on conversations like this and can typically solve a problem for a client without them needing to make a trip there and charge them.

- **Simplicity:** When creating a portal for clients, simplicity and ease of use is key. Clients really don't want to spend a bunch of time figuring out the portal, they just want to call you and pay you and be done. So if they are giving them a portal, it must be stupid simple and easy to use.

- **Data protection:** All client information should be protected and kept as safe as possible, especially payment information.

### Step 2 - Track Job Requests

- **Have a single source of truth on their end (CRM):** If they can have all customers within a database where they can track all their information, previous work, payment history, new requests, notes, and anything else that would be really helpful. A lot of time and information is lost updating this information and oftentimes this information does not even get updated which causes complications in the future.

- **Not requiring internet:** Viktor would want the latest updated version of the system to be available and fully usable to everyone regardless if they have internet or not. Once they connect back to the internet, anything that has changed could be automatically updated.

- **Ease of use for phone/tablet:** When working on the field, carrying a laptop is not ideal. You want something that is small and compact to use to get all the information and data to complete the job. If it's difficult to use on phone or tablet, that would not be good.

- **Simplicity:** Again, gathering information should be really easy for Viktor or staff members. If they have to look through large amounts of data just to find a customer and notes on the customer, that would not be ideal especially when you are out on the field. You should be able to get all the information you want quickly and efficiently.

- **Ability to customize the software based on how you like it:** Would be nice for customers, managers, staff, sales guys or whoever uses the software to have the ability to make small changes to how they see it on their end to best suit how they like it. It's not necessary but nice to have.

### Step 3 - Schedule Job Requests

- **Automated route scheduling:** If they can have it where routes are built based on reviewed parameters that they can set and change and all the required information is automatically updated under each appointment from that source of truth database that would be ideal. For seasonal service they can even have a prebuilt route that they follow every year for existing customers. Definitely would want the ability to review routes prior to mass texting all the clients on the routes their times to see how well it can build a route.

- **Mass texting clients their times:** Need it to handle reaching out to all clients about appointment times and the clients having the ability to accept or deny the time. If they deny the time, they can have the ability to give different times they are available and the AI can use this to find the next best available time for the client.

- **Customers have the ability to add in preferred service times in their portal:** Would be great if customers can update preferred service times as in when they will be available. This way the AI software can view this and find the best time available to suit the customer's availability.

- **Assigning dedicated staff to each route:** Want the software to automatically assign staff to each route of their choosing. Staff should be able to see their routes in advance on only their routes so they don't get mixed up with other people's routes.

- **Appointment reminders:** Software should notify clients about their scheduled appointment in advance and give them the ability to change their time if needed. It should also notify the clients when staff are on the way or if there is potential of being late. If being late, clients can either accept the new time or reschedule.

- **Ability to mark certain customers or jobs as priority or not:** Some customers are high priority customers and should have a way to be marked as high priority when building routes.

### Step 4 - Complete Job Requests

- **Materials needed:** Would be great if the software can have the ability to let staff know what materials they need to complete a job on a surface level. If it can bounce it up to what they have currently in the vehicle, that would be even better allowing the staff to know what may need to be restocked.

- **Simple to use tracking of route and appointment slot:** Staff should be able to have a very simple but efficient way to review their routes, individual appointment slots, key information about the client, and update information about the clients to the main database if needed.

- **Invoices, estimates, and more on the spot:** Staff need the ability to be able to invoice, estimate, sign agreements, or more on the spot in little to no time. They need the ability to do this quickly and customers need the ability to be able to receive this quickly on their end.

- **Staff should have a simple set process to follow:** Staff should have a step by step, start to finish process to follow when doing a job. If they don't complete one step, they cannot move on to the next.

- **Credit card scanners:** Staff should also carry credit card scanners with them to collect payment if the client cannot access the portal during that time.

- **Automatically update database:** All information updated within the appointment slot should automatically update the single source of truth database so they would not need to update anything additionally after the job is complete.

- **GPS Tracking:** Staff should be visible to managers and clients so that they can track where the staff are.

- **Notifying clients about arrival times:** Clients should be notified of expected arrival times and any changes in arrival. If a staff marks a job as complete, the next client should get notified they are on the way.

- **Standard price list:** Staff should have a standard price list they can access to give quotes/upsell jobs where they forgot price.

- **Notification if staff is going to be late:** Staff should be notified if they are taking too long at a job so they can make a decision either to be late or to reschedule the work.

- **Additional agreements and contracts:** If additional agreements or contracts are needed, staff should be able to get those over to the client quickly and clients should be able to review and sign quickly on the site.

- **Clear job instructions:** Staff should be able to read the job description and understand the assignment without any confusion. If there is any specialty notes or information they need to know, they should be able to see that.

- **Review collection:** Staff should be required to either collect a review or not collect a review (In case it seems like a bad client) before they leave the job.

### Step 5 - Close Job Requests

If the system is set up well to where staff close out each job on the spot, this last step won't be required by Viktor anymore. Even so, here are some key considerations in this step:

- **All information is automatically updated in the database:** All information updated from the staff once they close the job should be automatically updated in the site. For example if the staff collects payment via credit card on the spot, the database should automatically update that payment was collected and the amount collected. Another example, if the job needs to be rescheduled, the system should automatically update the database to note this job needs to be rescheduled again and mark it as needing to be prioritized or not.

- **Automated follow up for coming due or past due invoices/estimates:** Anything that is coming due and still not paid or past due should have an automated communication to remind clients.

- **Prepay or automatic mechanics lien notifications if customers don't pay:** To avoid clients not paying, have terms and conditions, contracts, and automated lien waiver notifications set up so clients get pushed to pay. They can also have prepay needing to be required for basic maintenance work (which is not considered improvement to property and cannot have a lien sent for) which includes seasonal services so they can collect all the money without the hassle.

- **Tracking all payments:** If paid via other online platforms like Venmo or Zelle, they should have a way to track that automatically without needing to read through all the payments. Or just straight up remove that option from them.

### Other Areas of Improvement

Here are some additional ideas that came up:

- **Accounting tracking:** Viktor should have the ability to review profit margins for each job so he can track spending. They should also have the ability to track all receipts and credit card spending based on various categories so they can have a way easier time for tax season.

- **Yearly service contracts (Tier based):** Having yearly tier based contracts would be a great option to have as many clients have expressed wanting to see this.

- **Terms and conditions/contracts:** They should have terms and conditions and contracts set up for every client for all work. They want the ability to have contracts put together quickly and terms and conditions signed by every customer so that they can go to court if needed.

- **Customer financing:** Would be a great option to present for people that want big projects done. They lost many jobs because customers were expecting smaller costs not realizing the cost was higher and did not do the jobs as they had no more money for it anymore.

- **Gather reviews:** Reviews is what helps them boost their google page and is what brings in a bunch of business. Viktor wants to have the ability to gain as many 5 star reviews as possible and have it all automated even if it's artificial.

- **Better estimate procedure:** It is a lot easier for a client to agree to an estimate for big projects when they have diagrams of what was discussed presented to them, or sample videos/projects of other projects completed instead of just giving them a price and that's it.

- **Regular automated marketing emails:** Viktor wants customers to be always emailed on new offers, deals on products, and whatever else to gain as much as possible. It would be great to also connect to software to google and figure out a way to have consistent lead flow all the time that they can scale as needed.

---

## Updated System/Process Mapping

Now that the current system, issues, and potential solutions have been covered, Viktor wanted to provide a vision of how the process should be.

### Lead Intake and Client Dashboard

The system starts off with lead intake which is how the system will bring in all the leads into a centralized client dashboard that the team can manage. The system will intake all leads and work requests and guide them to a formal sign up for the request from areas including but not limiting to:

- Website traffic and landing pages (Good buttons and AI text bot agents)
- Marketing strategies (Mass emails, mass text, flyers, google adds, social media adds, and more with a formal link, buttons, or QR codes clients can use)
- Calls and texts from google (AI agents answering calls/texts and guiding the client)
- Anywhere else (Any previous form of guiding them)

This will be as simple as clients clicking a button or scanning a QR code where they have the option to make their own login and account, or go through the request as a guest within either the website or the system itself (Viktor believes only one would be necessary and website would be the easiest to set up). Clients should be able to see services and or requests that can be made with associated prices (if applicable) before having to sign up or check out as guests and agree to their terms and conditions. The service/request information will be offered within the website, marketing strategies, and within the client portal. All communications to customers throughout this process will be handled by AI agents set up to eliminate the need for a person to speak with them. Clients will have the option to speak to a real person if the agent cannot resolve the issue either through live text or call. The system should intake or track this key information at the minimum from clients:

- First name
- Last name
- City
- Address
- Number
- Email Address
- Username
- Password
- Payment information (if request selected requires prepay)
- Service selected
- Agreement to their terms and conditions
- Approval of offers via email/text
- Approval of them sending texts

Customers that go through a formal sign up option have the ability to just login and select services they want, update key information, review payment/financing options, and more without needing to keep providing this information. Customers that go through guest options will need to keep providing this information and the system should separate these two types of clients.

Once the system takes the request from the client, it will be put into a centralized client dashboard that would only be visible from the person managing staff and customer relations (in this case Viktor). Within this section, the goal would be to get a general understanding of information quickly and easily but have the ability to look further into individual requests and clients if needed. Key features within the client dashboard include but do not limit to:

- Amount of requests that came in
- Requests that need immediate human attention (communication/follow up)
- Separation of different services/requests that came in (seasonal service, estimates, repair, install, etc.)
- Tracking of the amount of requests coming in over time
- Information of where the leads are coming from
- Information on the amount of revenue lost from not gaining a job
- New or existing customer
- Property type (Commercial/residential)
- Customer general availability or requested service times
- Other general information about the clients that may be helpful

From here, the system will automatically update the other key dashboards with key information and automatically populate/update a central database of information. The central database should be their single source of truth that will retrieve and supply all of their other key dashboards and be used to accurately pull any information they need for future reference. This database will include but not limit itself to the following information:

- Key client information submitted by clients (from client dashboard)
- Key client information submitted by the team (from any dashboard)
- Client service/job history (from scheduling dashboard)
- Client payment history (from accounting dashboard)
- Clients special notes, photos, videos, data (from staff/crew & sales dashboard)
- Client marketing/advertising information (from marketing/advertising dashboard)
- Anything else that would be helpful information to hold that will allow them to make key decisions to drive revenue

Once they have the initial requests from clients in and all initial information is gathered, they can then proceed with the next dashboards that will be used to complete the other processes of the complete system.

### Scheduling Dashboard

The scheduling dashboard is where all approved jobs and requests will be scheduled and assigned to staff/crews. The main goal with this dashboard is to review the jobs that have been approved and need to be completed and understand how much work they have. If they understand how far they are booked out, they can then let customers know roughly what their lead time is and make key decisions on if they need to hire people to handle the work or not. It will also give them an understanding of if they need to ramp up advertising/marketing to increase job flow. All actual scheduling, customer communication, and staffing should be automated and take little to no time/effort other than basic review. The scheduling dashboard should be split into two main sections, general scheduling information and granular scheduling information. The main purpose of the general scheduling section is to be able to quickly get a general understanding of what scheduling, staff availability, and lead times look like. Key information that the general scheduling section should include but is not limited to goes as follows:

- All approved jobs and requests that are ready to schedule including amount
- All approved jobs and requests that are scheduled including amount
- General calendar of scheduled jobs and staff/crews assigned to those jobs
- Staff/crew availability
- Rough lead time (Viktor found week by week is best)
- Any other information that may be helpful to get an understanding of scheduling

Within the scheduling dashboard, there would also be a more granular section where they can actually schedule the individual jobs, reach out to clients, and assign staff. The main goal here is to be able to quickly build, review and send out schedules to clients. The more automated it is here the better. The items that system will consider and use to build a schedule includes:

- Estimated time to complete
- Key customer and/or property information
- Job type
- When request was made
- Location
- Specialty materials or equipment needed
- Are they within a seasonal service period?
- Any key documents/information missing (for example, If a client approved an estimate but did not sign a contract yet).
- Weather data considerations
- Other key data that may be helpful
- Staff/crew availability
- Customer general availability

Once all this information has been considered by the system, with a click of a button it should be able to build Viktor a schedule for a specific day/week for each staff/crew. This schedule can then be reviewed by Viktor and staff members and make any adjustments as needed. It should be very easy to read and click into to find key information if needed. Once the schedule is reviewed and approved by managers and or staff, with a click of a button it should automatically send a push notification to all customers within the built schedule via text, email, and or customer dashboard. Customers should get a simple notification that shows service request, service cost, time proposed, and a confirmation option. The notification will also note that if clients don't confirm this appointment within a given amount of days, their appointment slot will be removed and they will need to make a form request again (to avoid people making a request but then not responding to them because they went with someone else and didn't let them know). If they confirm, it will automatically unmark that particular appointment from "pending" to "confirmed". If they can't make the proposed time, they have an option where they can give their availability that week and the following week and the system will gather that information and note that it will follow up with a new proposed time shortly. The system will then search for openings that week (in case other people also couldn't make the proposed time so it just swaps them and proposes the new time) or the following week based on what is available. Customers can also be reminded to update their requested service times in the client portal to avoid future scheduling conflicts.

Once the appointments are approved by customers (or them in special cases like scheduling for a builder or partner), clients will be notified that their appointment has been confirmed. Two days prior to the appointment, clients will be notified again of their upcoming appointments in case they forget.

### Staff/Crew Dashboard

The schedule will be sent to the staff/crews assigned to the job before and after their approval as described in the previous schedule. On the staff/crew end, they will only see their specific schedule and not other staff/crew's schedules. They will have a schedule with the individual appointment slots and each appointment slot will include key customer information as follows:

- Customer name
- Customer contact information
- Job type
- Location
- Materials/equipment needed
- Amount to collect or charge
- Time given to complete
- Key client data/history
- Key client directions (if applicable)
- Other applicable client details

The staff/crew should have a clear understanding of their route that day along with all the key data they need to complete the jobs on time and efficiently. In order to keep track of who is doing what, the admin side should have details about the staff as well to get an understanding of what is going on and make adjustments if needed. This includes but is not limited to:

- Staff Location (GPS Tracking)
- Current Job in progress
- Time left to complete the job
- The same notes and information as the staff
- Any other helpful information

Now that the key information is available and presented to both staff and admin, the system should then automate the communication to client about timing which includes but is not limited to:

- Automatic notification to client the day of job about estimated arrival time
- Automatic notification to client when staff is on his way and estimated time bounced off of travel time
- Automatic notification of delays and confirmation of client approval if delays are okay
- Notification of arrival

As the staff arrives, the staff will then be responsible to follow a process to complete the job in an effective and timely manner. The staff will have the following process to follow:

- Knock on client's door or call client if client is not present at the door
- Review job request with client
- Adjust prices/service (if applicable)
- Upsell additional work (if applicable)
- Start and complete job
- Present completed job to client (If applicable)
- Provide additional estimate (If applicable)
- Collect payment or invoice customer via the portal
- Request review if good candidate
- Update jobs notes (Completion status, amount paid/invoiced, if additional work or estimate is needed, materials used for accounting, other key client or property information)
- Mark appointment as complete

Each individual appointment slot will have its own client associated with it where the staff will have a place to be able to quickly provide estimates, invoices, request reviews, update notes, and whatever else is needed. The staff will additionally have resources like a standard price list and services list that they can use to quickly pull information to build estimates and invoices on the spot. Once the appointment is marked as completed by staff, the system should automatically notify the client of completion and provide the client with key information about the job (Job type, completion status, receipt or invoice, any additional notes). From there, that would be a cue for the system to notify the next client of when they could expect the staff to arrive. There should also be an option for staff to be able to do things like stop by a gas station to fill up if need be. Maybe the client gets a 30-45 minute time window instead of an exact time.

Additional key elements to consider:

- Payment will be either collected on the spot via credit card scanner, cash/check or route the client to pay via the portal. The staff should be able to draw up an invoice for the customer quickly and the customer should be able to receive the invoice right away once staff sends via a push notification.
- If a client requests additional work, a formal estimate should be able to be drawn up quickly and sent to the client for approval. Once approved, the staff can continue with the job. Viktor doesn't believe writing up an additional contract for them would be very efficient, he believes instead their terms and conditions should state something around the lines of "any estimate that is approved is considered as a formal contract agreement between both parties".
- If a staff member is spending too much time on an appointment, they will be notified of how much time they have left and if they should move on to the next appointment to avoid staying late on the job and being late to the next one.

The staff will only be updating each individual appointment slot that has a client attached to it. All information updated within will be automatically updated to the main database which will house all this data if needed for future reference along with updating other dashboards if needed. For example, if the staff sends an estimate and the client needs time to approve, the estimate will automatically be updated within the sales dashboard after 2 days of no approval. Or if special instructions require payment to be completed at a different time/way, it will automatically update the accounting dashboard. If jobs need to be scheduled again, it will automatically be sent to the scheduling dashboard.

### Sales Dashboard

The sales dashboard will house all the information needed to be able to take in leads and sell them a job before it gets scheduled. This will likely mainly house bigger projects like installs and landscaping projects, but it may also include smaller jobs that just need a face to the estimate and approval. The general sales dashboard should include but is not limited to:

- Estimates that need to be scheduled
- Estimates that are pending approval
- Estimates that need immediate human intervention
- Revenue to be gained from approval of estimates
- Key sales metrics helpful to gain customer insight throughout the season and years

A sales staff will have their own dashboard and schedule that they can use to schedule 1-1 estimates with potential clients. The scheduling process will be similar to the approved job scheduling process and staff arrival notifications to clients will follow the same process as well. Once a sales staff arrives on the estimate, the staff will consult with the client and be able to use the sales dashboard to build the client a quote on the spot. This feature will include but is not limited to:

- Estimate templates to be used to build ready to go estimates on the spot
- Estimate price adjustment options based on materials used/system design giving the client the ability to pick an option that will best fit their budget. This should have key details about pluses and minuses for the client that they can review
- Past videos, photos, and customer testimonials used to show clients what they are being sold and what they will achieve with purchasing the product.
- Basic level diagram or vision that could be built on the spot quickly of the current property and system design that the customer can review. This does not require to be anything fancy, it can simply be a birds eye view of their property with the rough view of the system. Another good idea would be to potentially implement an AI feature to be able to take photos of a specific area like a mulch bed and request the AI to change the colors of the mulch for example so customers can see what different colors look like.
- Estimate promotions if applicable

As the 1 on 1 meeting ends, all the above should be able to be provided to the customer through the sales portal at the end along with a link to approve and sign a contract for the estimate that the customer will see on the customer portal. The goal would be to get all this done during the sales meeting process without needing to provide anything additional post the 1 on 1 meeting. The customer will be able to review all the different documents, photos, videos, etc. provided during the estimate and help them make a decision of what they want. This should be high quality and very professional but very simple as this is the first thing the client will see and first impressions matter. If the client sees a very well put together estimate and estimate process and has a clear vision sold to them, they are more willing to go with Grin's Irrigation. As the sales staff marks the appointment complete, the next client in their schedule should be notified of the rough arrival time of the sales staff similar to before.

Post meeting, the sales staff will be able to use the sales portal to click into each individual estimate and review key information about a specific estimate. Key information that the sales staff will be able to review and edit includes but is not limited to:

- Estimate provided
- Price of estimate
- Applicable diagrams/photos/videos
- Contract(s) provided
- Customer information
- Last contact date
- Notes based on previous discussion
- Other helpful data for a sales staff to find helpful

The sales staff will be able to use this information to follow up with individual customers to try to sell them on the project and get the customer to turn over. The sales staff should have promotional options available to use to try to convince the customer to agree to the estimate. The sales staff will also have an automated notification option which they can select for a given estimate to automatically send push notifications to selected clients reminding them of the estimate and trying to get them to approve. The automated function will be sent out every 3-5 days until either the customer approves or disapproves the estimate.

As with all the other dashboards, all items within here will be automatically updated to the central database to be referenced for the future if applicable.

### Accounting Dashboard

The accounting dashboard will house all the numbers to be able to gain key insights on profit margins, customer spending data, and other key insights. It will also house important information on invoicing data. This dashboard will mainly be used by an admin to review key accounting data.

On the general dashboard, the admin will be able to view key metrics and get a general understanding of accounting. The general dashboard will include but is not limited to:

- Year to date profit (options to go further out than a year)
- Year to date revenue (options to go further out than a year)
- Pending invoices within the allotted payment period (includes total amount pending)
- Past due invoices (includes total amount pending)
- Spending metrics per category and staff member
- Average profit margin
- Other key metrics that may be useful to gain insight

The accounting dashboard should have an invoicing section to review key invoice data. In terms of the pending invoices, the system will automatically notify customers through a push notification 3 days before the invoice is past due and weekly after the invoice is past due. In their terms and conditions, they will have a section that discusses past due invoice late fees and mechanic lien information if the client decides to not pay. If the client does not pay after 30 days, the system will send a formal notification to the property owner about a lien notification notifying clients that a formal lien will be sent if payment is not completed within the next week. **Note, lien notifications have to be sent within 45 days of job completion or materials provided on the job and can only be sent for services that improve the property. Services a lien cannot be sent for include start up, winterization, diagnostics, summer tune up. All other services can have a lien sent. Formal liens have 120 days to be sent post job completion or materials provided which will be sent 45 days after invoice is sent. For all seasonal services, payment will be collected up front as they cannot send liens for those services. If they can, they would also like to have a credit on file to charge a client if need be.** The goal of having this process in place is to have a set system to follow to avoid wasting time collecting payment.

In terms of key system processes in place to collect and store financial data, the whole goal of this process is to collect information to draw insights for the future if adjustments need to be made to material cost, prices, payment of staff, and whatever else. The financial data part of the dashboard should include but is not limited to these following items:

- Material cost for each job
- Staff cost for each job
- Total money received from the specific job
- Customer acquisition cost (through marketing)
- Fuel and maintenance costs of equipment (maybe through a standard cost per hour or mile?)
- Other costs that could bring key insights

The system then uses this key information and does the basic math needed to draw up general financial data/job specific financial data. They can do things like connect their credit cards and banking information to the system and use that financial data to collect spending on materials, equipment, fuel, etc. They can also draw metrics like miles needed to travel or equipment hours used from specific jobs that can be collected by staff or the system that can then have a specific multiplier to it (for example IRS does around $0.66 per mile traveled).

The accounting dashboard should also have a tax section which will help them collect and store all key tax information to be used to effectively and accurately complete their taxes for the season. This will include but is not limited to:

- Material spending amount
- Insurance spending amount
- Equipment usage amount
- Equipment service costs
- Office materials spending
- CRM System, marketing/advertising, subcontracting etc.
- Other spending that will be written off
- Revenue from each job

The system will have a feature in place to take photos and store all receipts throughout the season to avoid losing and counting all receipts during the tax season. It will take those photos and draw the amount from the receipts and then they could select to put it into a specific category. The system will then take in all of this information and give them an estimated total tax amount due that they can reference throughout the season to be able to make key decisions to reduce tax amount due. They should have an option to propose future spending to see how their taxes will be adjusted if they do that spending. The whole goal of this section is to have a clear view throughout the season of their tax situation and be able to make key tax decisions before it's too late.

### Marketing/Advertising Dashboard

The system will also have a marketing/advertising dashboard that can be used to deliver key insights on marketing/advertising strategy. The whole goal of this dashboard is to be able to use key information to have a consistent lead flow and give them the ability to put $5 in and get $10 out (don't worry about the exact dollar amount, just an example). They want to supply their staff with consistent work and automate the lead flow process as much as possible. If they can get it to a point where they know a strategy/location of spending that they can follow to increase lead flow at any point in time, the business becomes more and more scalable. The general dashboard will include but not be limited to this data:

- Where leads are coming from (they can collect from places like when customers sign up to the portal)
- Average customer acquisition cost (bounce total spending per category to total money earned)
- What places they are advertising in
- Marketing/Advertising budget
- Other key metrics to draw insights from

The system should also have automated features that allow for mass emailing/texting for promotions and deals. They should have an option to start various email/text campaigns within the system that will automatically be sent out to their customer list based on their set parameters. The whole goal of this would be to try to continue getting more money out of their existing customers that already work with them.

### Other

A proper and professional website is essential for new customers as it's an area of first impression. The website will be a central funnel of leads to the system as it will provide the ability for customers to schedule appointments and review customer testimonials/videos, and sign up for services. Website features include but are not limited to:

- Services offered, prices, and service location (tiered)
- Customer portal sign up option and guest option (houses all customer data)
- Quick appointment scheduling option
- AI chatbot to answer basic questions and lead customers to various landing pages without needing to talk to human
- Content page that is regularly updated with links to social media. Viktor wants it to be connected to a point where if he just posts a video on a website, all his social media also automatically gets that same post posted.
- Real customer testimonials and feedback
- Design page (for customers to design a system themselves and get a real time quote without the team even needing to be there. Kind of like designing custom shoes or custom car on the seller's site)
- SEO optimization
- About page and company history to learn about who they are
- Very simple design to lead customers to sign up or request a service
- Data about being number one in the area or whatever other marketing content
- Coupon or promotions page
- Troubleshooting page
- Financing options
- Contact option
- Free instant quote
- FAQs

Essentially the goal of this website is to build a very well put together and optimized website that will put them at the top of people's searches with ChatGPT, search engines, and other areas. From there a client will get a good first impression of who they are and what they have to offer and more likely want to work with them as they look very professional versus other companies that have very crappy websites.
